## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 1. API Key Management
- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Use environment variables or secret management services
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use the principle of least privilege for API keys

```bash
# Good: Using environment variables
export LIBRARIES_IO_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Bad: Hardcoding in code
LIBRARIES_IO_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"  # Never do this!
```

#### 2. Network Security
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Configure firewalls appropriately
- Use VPNs for accessing in production
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

#### 3. Input Validation
- Always validate user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Sanitize user-generated content
- Implement proper error handling

### For Developers

#### 1. Secure Coding Practices
```python
# Good: Use type hints and validation
from typing import Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel, constr

class PackageRequest(BaseModel):
    platform: constr(min_length=1, max_length=50)
    name: constr(min_length=1, max_length=100)
    version: Optional[str] = None

# Bad: No validation
def get_package(platform, name, version=None):
    # No input validation - vulnerable to injection attacks
    pass
```

#### 2. Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use dependency scanning tools
- Monitor for known vulnerabilities
- Use pinned versions in production

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
pip-audit

# Update dependencies
pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
```

#### 3. Error Handling
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- Use generic error messages for users
- Log detailed errors for debugging
- Implement proper error handling

```python
# Good: Secure error handling
try:
    result = await client.get_package_info(platform, name)
except LibrariesIOClientError as e:
    logger.error(f"API error: {e}")
    return {"error": "Service temporarily unavailable"}
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    return {"error": "Internal server error"}

# Bad: Exposing sensitive information
try:
    result = await client.get_package_info(platform, name)
except Exception as e:
    return {"error": f"Database error: {str(e)}"}  # Exposes internal details
```

## Security Features

### 1. Rate Limiting
The server implements rate limiting to prevent abuse:

```python
# Configuration
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS = 100  # requests per window
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 3600   # seconds (1 hour)
```

### 2. Input Validation
All inputs are validated using Pydantic models:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, constr, conint

class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
    query: constr(min_length=1, max_length=200)
    platforms: Optional[list[constr(max_length=20)]] = None
    page: conint(ge=1, le=100) = 1
    per_page: conint(ge=1, le=100) = 10
```

### 3. Authentication
API keys are required for all requests:

```python
# API Key validation
def validate_api_key(api_key: str) -> bool:
    if not api_key or len(api_key) < 10:
        return False
    # Additional validation logic
    return True
```

### 4. HTTPS Support
The server supports HTTPS for secure communication:

```python
# HTTPS configuration
app = FastMCP(
    title="Libraries.io MCP Server",
    description="Secure MCP server for Libraries.io API",
    version="0.1.0"
)
```

## Security Testing

### 1. Automated Security Scanning
We use multiple tools to scan for vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Run security scans
npm audit  # For Node.js dependencies
pip-audit  # For Python dependencies
bandit -r src/  # For Python security issues
semgrep --config=p/security src/  # For security patterns
```

### 2. Manual Security Testing
- Penetration testing by security professionals
- Code reviews focused on security
- Threat modeling sessions
- Security awareness training

### 3. Dependency Scanning
Regular scanning of dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Generate SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
pip-compile --generate-hashes requirements.in

# Check for vulnerabilities
trivy image libraries-io-mcp-server:latest
```

## Data Protection

### 1. Personal Data

- API keys are stored securely
- No user tracking or analytics
- No logging of sensitive information

### 2. Data Encryption

- No sensitive data in logs
- Database connections use SSL/TLS

### 3. Data Retention

- API keys are not stored after use
- Temporary data is cleared after processing
